            <div class="a">
              <p>Illini EV Concept designs and builds electric vehicles from scratch in a sustainable manner and races it in the Annual Shell Eco Marathon. Besides the construction of the car, we also are implementing autonomous capabilities into the vehicle. My particular role in the club is a project lead for both the software department as well as the business department.
                In the software department, I explore and implement object and lane detection into the vehicle, with has yielded the opportunity to work with OpenCV, Yolo5, and PyTorch.
                In the business department, a few projects I'm involved in include the collection and analysis of team data using Microsoft Excel, restructuring the club to increase member retention and satisfaction, as well as manage the club outreach initiative, which I started.

        <h6>(August 2021-August 2022)</h6>
        <div class="a">
          <p>Illini Air Shuttle designs an electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft for commercial use. I manage a team that CAD models the aircraft with Solidworks and OpenVSP. In addition to modeling the aircraft, I am also involved in testing the aerodynamics of the craft, specifically wing placement to reduce tailwind interference experienced by the rear wings. This was predominantly worked on using Fluent, the Ansys fluid solver, but I also am working on a python genetic algorithm to automatically calculate the ideal wing configuration using given parameters.</p>
